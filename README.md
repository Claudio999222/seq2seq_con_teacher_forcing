# Seq2Seq with Teacher Forcing for English to Italian Translation

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with teacher forcing for the task of English to Italian translation. The Seq2Seq architecture, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is widely used for sequence generation tasks, including machine translation.

## Key Components:

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Utilize a dataset containing English-Italian sentence pairs for training the translation model. Preprocess the data by tokenizing and padding the sequences.

2. **Seq2Seq Model Architecture**: Define the architecture of the Seq2Seq model, including an encoder and a decoder. Implement the attention mechanism to improve the model's ability to focus on different parts of the input sequence.

3. **Teacher Forcing**: Explain and implement the teacher forcing technique, where the true target outputs are fed as inputs to the decoder during training. This accelerates learning and improves convergence.

4. **Training the Model**: Train the Seq2Seq model on the English-Italian translation dataset. Monitor training metrics such as loss to evaluate the model's performance.

5. **Inference**: Implement the inference process to translate new English sentences into Italian using the trained model.

## Why Seq2Seq with Teacher Forcing?

- **Improved Training Stability**: Teacher forcing helps stabilize training by providing reliable and correct inputs during the training phase.

- **Faster Convergence**: The model tends to converge faster with teacher forcing, as it receives accurate information about the expected outputs.

- **Handling Variable-Length Sequences**: Seq2Seq models with attention and teacher forcing handle variable-length input and output sequences effectively.

This notebook serves as a practical example of implementing Seq2Seq with teacher forcing for a specific NLP task â€“ English to Italian translation.
